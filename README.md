# Alien_Invasion.py
"""The file alien_invasion.py is the main game file where you can run the game through the terminal,
all other files are modules that have been written as classes and/or methods to add to the main game file
and keep everything organised as I go along. This is my first project I've written, been an interesting ride
so far!"""
